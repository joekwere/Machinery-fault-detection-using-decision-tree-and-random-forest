# Machinery-fault-detection-using-decision-tree-and-random-forest
In this project, two machine learning models capable of detecting machinery faults based on vibration sensor readings was developed to detect the presence of a fault in a manufacturing plant's machinery were developed using random forest and decision tree were compared
